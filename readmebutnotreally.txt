this is my personal portfolio app built using flutter, nothing too fancy, just something that does what it’s supposed to do. it shows who i am, what i’ve worked on, and what i’m interested in. i made it responsive so it works on pretty much everything, web, phones, tablets. i kept the ui minimal, i just want people to see my work without having to scroll through a slideshow of buzzwords (i hate linkedin).

the app is made entirely with flutter and dart, no unnecessary packages or bloated libraries. it was more of a learning experience than anything else, a way for me to actually apply the flutter knowledge instead of just watching tutorials and forgetting everything two days later. it has the usual stuff: about me, skills, projects, contact, basic but functional.

if you want to run it locally, it’s simple. clone the repo, run flutter pub get, then flutter run. no setup hell, no 15 step guide, just flutter things.

now let’s talk about linkedin, because of course i have to mention it. yes, i have an account. no, i don’t like using it. linkedin is the most painfully fake corner of the internet. it’s like corporate cosplay. everyone’s out here writing posts that sound like ai wrote them during a midlife crisis. every job update is a “journey”, every resignation is a “chapter closing”, and every comment section is filled with people pretending to care so they can farm likes and maybe land a freelance gig. the whole vibe just makes my skin crawl. i’m not gonna write a paragraph about how “thrilled” i am to start an internship, i’ll just do the work and keep it moving.

so yeah, if you’re looking for the linkedin link, it exists, but i’m not proud of it. check out my github instead, or just shoot me an email like a normal person.

linkedin – if you really must, it’s out there, just don’t expect anything inspiring
